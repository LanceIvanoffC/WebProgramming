    <h1>About Lab 2</h1>

    <p>
        The reason for lab 2 is to learn about two new thing. The first one is relative <br>
        and absolute paths. Relative paths only show to way to get to the other from the file you are<br>
        currently in. Absolute paths show a way to get to another file from anywhere in the whole system.<br>
        The second thing is tables. How to construct tables and put content inside of them <br>
        whether its just or or hyperlinks.
